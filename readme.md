*Method Draw is not actively developed, nor there are plans for it in the future. It is only updated when browser upgrades break the application.*

![Method Draw](https://method.ac/assets/editor.png)

Method Draw is a fork of [SVG Edit](https://github.com/SVG-Edit/svgedit), a web based vector drawing application.

The purpose of Method Draw is to improve the usability and user experience of SVG Edit. It removes some features such as layers and line-caps/corners in exchange for a more simple and pleasant experience.

Development takes place in `/editor` 
Run this directory on a local webserver such as `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

To compile:

first `make clean` 
then `make -b`

Method Draw will be compiled into the `method-draw` directory, which you can then deploy anywhere you choose.
